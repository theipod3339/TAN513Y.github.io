What we did

Hello again! In today's IT lesson, we got set up and tried to find the work that we did last week on our USB stick. Unfortunately, we could only find some baby pictures of me, so we had to start again. In future, I know that we need to click all files on the USB stick, to find our work. We then started our next task, learning about variables (words that store other digits) which took us most of the lesson. At the end of our task, we had got the computer to say We have 6 apples, if we eat one then we have 5 apple. Then it said: We have 5 apples, if we eat one we have 4 apples, etc. It repeated that sentence until there were no apples left… :  (.

In the lesson, we got on with the task very quickly and efficiently, so that was very good. We also understood what variables were, which is what we were trying to do!

The only thing that could've been better was if we had got on to the next task.
