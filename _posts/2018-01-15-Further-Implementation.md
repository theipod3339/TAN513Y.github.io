Taxes and Profits...

In google sheets you can create a table for lots of different things. It can be simply to store data, to show data (e.g. as a table or graph) or for a things such as a shop.

A table can include many factors such as including profits and calculating discounts. Some different types of discounts include:

-discount on the total

-discount before tax

Today I managed to sort out what the profits were after tax. Profits were at 20% and next week I am going to add prices before and after tax and have the profits changed to be as they should, although I already started this and I already know how I am going to do this.
