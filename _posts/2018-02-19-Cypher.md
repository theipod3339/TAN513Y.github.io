Encryption 

In today's we had a go at making a simple encryption. This was based on the Caesar Cypher meaning all letters are moved forward x times so for instance if it was +2 encryption the word 'hello’ would be ‘jgnnq’ the decryption does the opposite. We did this by having a vlookup which goes through a given alphabet. You can also have the alphabet starting with a word so if the code word is ‘armadillo’the alphabet lookup would be;armdilobcefghjkmnpqstuvexyz. The cypher makes each letter one across so there in sense three tables. One original and one which the letters will Be after encryption.k
