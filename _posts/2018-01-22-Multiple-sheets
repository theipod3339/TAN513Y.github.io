How you can make certain data separate and easy to read. 

In today's lesson we looked at how when your selling items you don't need all of the information in front of you all the time. What I did was make a seperate sheet on which only the essential information was displayed. I.e. the total and quantity. This made it easy to read the necessary data and it helped to organize everything. I successfully transferred all the required code and data over making sure it was still looking inside the right sheet. I have also added the price with and without tax. Next week I will add all of my profits into the group. In the future I also want to add discount codes giving money off certain things like before and after tax. Also I want to add other expenditures and update all the other necessary fields to make this work.
