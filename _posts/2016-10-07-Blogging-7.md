  <tr>
    <td>I built a small database on the left hand side of my spreadsheet.  I imagined I owned a small shop and had an inventory of items and prices.  On the right I have a section that allows you to type the item in.  It automatically finds the item from the list and inserts the correct price.  We used a VLOOKUP in order to interrogate the inventory and supply the correct price. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We also have a section that creates a total for the order and also has an option to apply a discount.  This discount can be a variable, and the program is designed to recalculate the total based on this.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Now I have the program working, I can think about other functionality.  I have published the Google Sheet which creates an "embed code" which I have added to the POST once this Google Doc has been published to GitHub.  It creates an “iframe” which already has parameters set in my style sheet (.scss) from when I learnt about embedding YouTube videos.</td>
