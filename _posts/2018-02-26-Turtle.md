Today I learned some basic functions of Turtle in python such as turtle.forward and turtle.color('aqua'). We made shapes by making a ‘line’ move forward x and then turing x degrees. We then made a (for i in range) to make multiple shapes at the same time as well as some formula as you can see below.
